			Banana is indeed a fruit that can be created in many ways, from frying, roasting to boiling it into compote. In the city of Makassar, there is a typical food made from processed bananas, known as banana epe. These bananas are cooked by roasting half-cooked which is then pressed until flattened. Pisang Epe is then doused with brown sugar sauce with a variety of tempting toppings.</p>
			<p>4. Jalangkote <br>

			At first glance, Jalangkote is similar to pastels except that the skin is thinner. The filling is also different from pastels, consisting of potatoes, bean sprouts, carrots and laksa. The skin is also crisper and tastier because there is additional coconut milk in the ingredients. Jalangkote Makassar is a popular snack that you can get at several cafes at affordable prices.</p>
